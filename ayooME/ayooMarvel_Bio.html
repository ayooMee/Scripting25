                    <p>Yurrr! Name's Marvel and thanks for spending your TikTok time here. I'd like to think I'm a creator, lazy but passionate about bringing ideas to life. Honestly I just want to make cool stuff, but I've been told it needs to have a "story" attached to it unless it rings "hollow". Whether I'm working on a verse or experimenting with video editing, I'm always looking for ways to create rather than consume, because lord knows I consume (ban TikTok please I beg).</p>
                    
                    <p>My journey started in grade 6 when I moved to a new school from Montreal. It was lunch time, some kids sat down around me and said "Let's run a freestyle". Having no idea what that was (little Nigerian immigrant boy that I was) I stayed quiet. After one round I was hooked, and that was the first day of the rest of my life. I went home and innocently typed in "rap" on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=rap" target="_blank"> try it</a> and see who pops up, for me it was Eminem. I now record music, write poems - honestly it's been a while since I wrote something that didn't rhyme.</p>

                    <p>Music dragged me along to other creative avenues as well. For example, I love movies, adore movies. But my love for cinema came from watching music videos, seeing references to iconic movies in them before I ever saw the movies themselves. I've always thought it was a roundabout way to fall in love with film. I'm telling you, all roads lead back to that lunch table.</p>

                    <p>When I'm not writing the greatest or worst thing I've ever heard, I love living life. Partying, yes, but also having a two-hour conversation with the old lady at the bus stop, and grabbing my camera and asking for dad jokes in exchange for a photo. While I'm out there I might as well capture interesting textures and lighting - these moments of observation help me see the world through a lens that one day hopefully will be unique to me. I also enjoy playing video games, which teaches me about interactive design, user experience, and the importance of visual storytelling in digital spaces, but 70% of the time my brain is off and I'm just having fun with friends.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe that creativity is about continuous learning and experimentation. I'd say I have huge creative potential, and like huge biceps (coming soon), if you don't use them you lose them. Every project is an opportunity to try something new, make mistakes (I'm really good at this), and grow as an artist. My goal is to build a diverse portfolio that showcases my skills while working toward... honestly if I can feed myself and maybe a small dog off anything art related I'll be happy. Writing music would be my pick if I wasn't a beggar. But to me, finding myself in a situation where I can collaborate with other creatives and contribute to exciting projects is a win.</p>

That evolved into writing little love poems for a crush in grade 8. High school I wrote a diss track on a friend, and then before I know it I circled back to writing poems, and performing them at people's faces, not sliding them into their desk...crazy I know</p>
